        <!--      This was my examination project from the 1-year course "programming
          for artists" which is held at Konstfack in Stockholm. For my final
          project I looked at my own messenger data and sort of analysed my self
          in a sense. It was a VR-project and I used the virtual space to be
          able to see my own data in large amounts. -->

          Managing the Self (working title) comes from the idea that the
          identity or the notion of the self would be something statistical or
          mesurable. This idea came to be when I found out you can download all
          of your data from Facebook into a folder. My first intention was that
          I simply wanted to analyze this data, turns out there is already a
          well integrated online tool that is doing just that. Here is a guide
          on downloading your own data and the web tool for analysing:

          This got me thinking what else I could do with my data and through my
          recently acquired knowlegde in Python and JavaScript (two programming
          languages) I started filtering through my data with the aim of somehow
          projecting it into 3D space in an virtual environment.

          Im inspired by the german writer Hans-Georg Moeller who talks about
          this concept that we live in a time of "profilicity" where the
          creation of self is about curating and managing different social
          profiles, both online and IRL. He argues that this is emerging in
          contrast to an earlier idea of finding your truest or most authentic
          self within, which he ascribes as the period of "authenticity".
          Moeller himself says he is inspired by chinese philosophy and by
          daoism in regard to these concepts.

          I'm also inspired by the though-provoking and interesting short
          article "Thinking post-identity" by Judith Roof. I think it gave me an
          extra push in really thinking "I'm here in my data, let's measure
          myself!" It is not so much about digitization or any other theme in
          particular but rather presents a way of thinking about identity in a
          certain way.
        </p>

        <em class="review--text">
          "Post-identity looks both at the ways identity categories are deployed
          to sustain the status quo and at the ways alternative notions of
          identity already exist that defy, deconstruct, or perversely alter
          power asymmetries. The idea, [...] is to avoid the structuralist,
          binary thinking that can only reproduce itself and the sets of
          empowerments, oppositional epistemologies, categorical
          generalizations, and economies that inhere."

          The images above are outtakes from the VR-experience that was the
          result of this project. This last image is my favourite, it's messy,
          it is an overload of information and a trace of my digital presence!
